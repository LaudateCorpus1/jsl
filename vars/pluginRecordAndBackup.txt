# pluginRecordAndBackup

## Description

Generates two lists of the currently installed plugins. The first is a list of all the plugins with their currently installed version. The second is a
list of all installed plugins, with all *unpinned* plugins having the "latest" version, and all pinned plugins (provided by a parameter) having the
version they are pinned to.

The intention is that automatic backups can be performed (potentially into a git repository) with these list included, and that the first list (with 
the exact versions) can be used for troubleshooting bad plugin updates, and the second (only pinned at exact versions) can be used for automatic
deployments/automatic updates.

Additionally, it can optionally backup the plugin archives for pinned versions of plug-ins, to ./plugins/<plugin-name>.<plugin-version>.jpi
